"main" should just initialize the kernel and tell it to run the next process while we've still got CPU and processes to run, then "shut down" the kernel at the end of the tick.

kernel has a process table, schedules the processes by priority, and manages/records how much CPU we've used so far this tick.
may also handle suspension at end of tick in shutdown.

init - spawn essential/progenitor processes for that tick.
  - memory management
  - room managers
  - queues up the "suspension" task for all un-completed processes at the end of the tick

memory management process handles cleanup and memory structure. until I figure out or realize a need for anything more complex, it will just keep creeps cleaned up out of memory.

room managers - manage room needs and mechanics, spawns subprocesses:
  - energy management
  - spawn management
  - construction management
  - conflict/army management
  - room memory data management

energy manager - energy distribution and gathering
  -

spawn manager - spawn structure, creep spawn queues, pairs creeps+lifecycle

construction management - manages builds based on RCL, GCL, etc

conflict manager - watches for incursions, decides when to attack, and coordinates defense/offense measures

room memory data manager - updates room memory content infrequently or event-based ([de]construction events)

CREEPS

lifecycle types:
  -

ECONOMY:
  - determine income, upkeep.
  - spawners should reference our income rate to determine sustainable creep sizes?
    - creep cost per tick
    - calculate creep energy generation per tick (use best-case paths)
  - certain actions or "capabilities" of a room should be gated behind income levels
    - expansion
    - active militia vs towers
    - road count
    - RCL upgrade speed


NEW THOUGHTS:
jobs!
example:
  - energy manager sees an open source, sends a job to the room controller to harvest it.
  - if the job queue hasn't shrunk recently, room manager orders a creep from the spawner that matches the job type. If the spawner is currently spawning a creep of the right type for that queue, don't queue another spawn yet.
